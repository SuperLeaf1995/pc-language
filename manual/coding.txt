Coding convention

Potato-C is a unique language wich looks like a bad spinoff of C--. Trough
it is not, and aims to achieve more.

Let's start by setting ra8 to zero.

routine foo() {
	copy(0,ra8);
	return;
}

now ra8 is set to zero.
Potato-C will transform this code into:

x86
[section .text]

_foo:
	mov al, 0
	ret
	
x64
[section .text]
_foo:
	mov al, 0
	ret
	
6502
_foo:
	ldx #$0
	rts
